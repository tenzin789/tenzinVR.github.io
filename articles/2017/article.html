        <h2>5 Practical Uses of VR in Classroom</h2>
        <p>For many teachers, the idea of implementing virtual reality (VR) into the curriculum seems like a far-fetched notion. The technology seems too expensive, too primitive, or too impractical to fit into a typical class period.

        <p>However, recent years have seen rapid advancements in the technology, resulting in affordable and advanced hardware and software that show serious potential. There are even a number of free VR applications for educators.</p>

        <aside>
          <q>students often feel like it has no practical application in their day-to-day lives. VR can bridge that gap by presenting them with immersive visualizations of math problems...</q>

          <ol>
            <li><h3>UNDERSTAND THE WORLD (AND BEYOND)</h3></li>
          <p>When it comes to teaching the basics of science—including the structure of the life, the origins of natural phenomena, and our place in the universe—nothing is as immersive as VR.</p>

          <p>Simulations, visual representations of data, and interactive games can be used as tools to help students understand everything from the building blocks of life to the workings of our solar system. Such applications let kinesthetic learners get hands-on with subjects that are usually discussed in abstract terms.</p>

          <p>Lab simulations, like those offered by Labster, even allow students to participate in independent investigations of subject material. This is a surprisingly affordable approach to science education; indeed, it could be argued that the virtual <q>equipment</q> on offer in these simulations alone can justify the cost of VR technology.</p>

          <li><h3>VISUALIZE MATHEMATICS</h3></li>
          <p>Mathematical knowledge is integral to solving many real-world problems. Nevertheless, students often feel like it has no practical application in their day-to-day lives. VR can bridge that gap by presenting them with immersive visualizations of math problems.</p>

          <p>For example, one of the biggest hurdles for young learners is understanding the basics of algebra. The abstract nature of the subject can make it difficult for some students to progress. In VR, however, algebraic problems can be represented through virtual objects.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, students who lack the spatial abilities to visualize a problem—such as those presented in Geometry or Trigonometry—can benefit from well-designed VR tutorials and activities. Because virtual environments are, by their nature, three-dimensional, they permit learners to interact with mathematical problems in an unprecedented way. Such experiences give them the mental framework to understand future problems, effectively improving their spatial abilities.</p>

          <p>In both of these examples, VR can improve a student’s ability to think logically. By being presented with virtual representations of mathematical problems, pupils can learn to visualize solutions independently.</p>

          <li><h3>TAKE VIRTUAL FIELD TRIPS</h3></li>
          <p>A virtual field trip consists of a guided tour of distant places. Whether you want to take your class to explore distant lands, other cultures, or unique geographical landmarks, there are plenty of options. When paired with effective instruction, students should be able to acquire the same benefits as though they actually visited that location.</p>

          <p>A big benefit to using virtual field trips is, simply put, the enthusiasm it can generate. When discussing Google Expeditions, Google’s foray into virtual reality tours, Product Manager Ben Schrom notes that virtual reality can <q>(m)ake at least bite-sized moments of experiential learning a much, much more regular occurrence at schools.</q>

          <p>Virtual field trips may not drastically change instruction, but they can create <q>impressionable learning moments.</q> Such trips can generate a great deal of enthusiasm for subject material and encourage pupils to get invested in their learning.</p>

          <li><h3>TAKE A TRIP BACK IN HISTORY</h3></li>
          <p>Just as VR can transport users across the world, it can also be used to simulate historical events from the past.</p>

          <p>For example, if you are currently teaching literature that’s based in the years of the first world war, you may want to give students an idea of what it was like to live during the years of the first World War. Trench Experience VR is a free application that gives users an intimate look into the life of those who fought during WWI.</p>

          <p>In a similar vein, the technology can be used to take <q>tours</q> of museums for further context, whether it be historical exhibits or other works of art from the era—and notable institutions have embraced it. Never before have learners been able to tour the Guggenheim, the Smithsonian, and the Louvre with such ease.</p>

          <li><h3>USE CREATIVE EXPRESSION AND ASSESSMENT</h3></li>
          <p>Any teacher who has recently assigned (yet another) poster presentation assignment knows how yawn-inducing such a task can be for the average student. Learners need new ways to express themselves and VR opens many avenues for creative expression.</p>

          <p>If you want an idea of how the technology can open new doors for artistically inclined students, look at what can be produced by Google-created VR tools like Tilt Brush and Blocks. Such creations can be used to demonstrate learning and express new ideas.</p>

          <p>For teachers who are looking for a more structured experience, there are other, more elaborate, tools for creating presentations as well. Applications like CoSpaces allow users to create three-dimensional worlds, populate them with premade or custom models, and guide peers through their creation. This can be an exciting way for learners to demonstrate what they’ve learned and generate constructive class discussions.</p>
